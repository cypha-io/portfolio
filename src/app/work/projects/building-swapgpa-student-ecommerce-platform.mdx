## Overview

Development of SwapGPA, a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed specifically for students, enabling them to buy and sell goods within their campus communities.

## Key Features

- **Secure Payment Integration**: Implemented multiple payment gateways including mobile money, card payments, and digital wallets to cater to diverse student needs across different regions.
- **Inventory Management System**: Built a robust inventory tracking system with real-time stock updates, automated low-stock alerts, and supplier integration.
- **Community Features**: Developed student community forums, exclusive deals, campus updates, and social commerce features to enhance user engagement.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Created responsive web and mobile applications optimized for student users with fast loading times and intuitive navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building a fast, SEO-friendly e-commerce platform.
- **Node.js & Express**: For backend API development and payment processing.
- **MongoDB**: For flexible data storage of products, users, and transactions.
- **Stripe/PayPal**: For secure payment processing.
- **React Native**: For mobile app development.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was implementing secure payment systems that work across different African countries with varying mobile money providers. We solved this by integrating multiple payment gateways and creating a unified payment abstraction layer. Another challenge was building trust in an online marketplace, which we addressed through user verification systems, escrow services, and community ratings.

## Outcome

SwapGPA has become a thriving platform serving thousands of students across multiple campuses, facilitating peer-to-peer commerce while building a strong student community. The platform continues to grow with new features and expanded market reach.
