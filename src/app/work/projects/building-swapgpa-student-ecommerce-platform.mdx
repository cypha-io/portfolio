## Overview

SwapGPA is a student-focused e-commerce platform that revolutionizes how students buy and sell goods within their campus communities. Built from the ground up to address the unique needs of African students, the platform facilitates secure peer-to-peer commerce while fostering community connections.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Payment Gateway Integration**: Supports mobile money (MTN, Vodafone), card payments, and digital wallets tailored for African markets.
- **Real-time Inventory Management**: Advanced stock tracking with automated alerts and supplier integration.
- **Campus Community Features**: Student forums, exclusive deals, campus-specific marketplaces, and social commerce capabilities.
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Responsive web application with mobile optimization for seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Modern React framework for fast, SEO-optimized web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development for scalable and maintainable code.
- **Node.js**: Backend API development and server-side logic.
- **MongoDB**: Flexible NoSQL database for product catalogs and user data.
- **Stripe Integration**: Secure payment processing infrastructure.

## Challenges and Learnings

Implementing payment systems across different African countries presented unique challenges with varying mobile money providers and regulatory requirements. We developed a unified payment abstraction layer that handles multiple gateways seamlessly. Building trust in peer-to-peer marketplaces required implementing robust user verification, escrow services, and community-driven rating systems.

## Outcome

SwapGPA serves thousands of students across Ghanaian campuses, creating a thriving ecosystem for student commerce. The platform continues to evolve with new features, expanded regional coverage, and enhanced community engagement tools.
